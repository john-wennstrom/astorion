# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately.

- Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability") if available for this repository.
- Otherwise: contact the maintainers privately using the contact details listed on their GitHub profile(s).

If you are unsure whether an issue is security-related, report it anyway and we’ll help triage.

## What we consider “security”

We consider the following to be security issues:

- Crashes, panics, or denial-of-service triggers from untrusted input
- Memory safety issues (including unsafe code misuse)
- Logic issues that could lead to incorrect interpretation of time ranges in security-sensitive contexts
- Supply-chain risks (malicious dependencies, compromised release artifacts)

## Response expectations

We aim to:

- Acknowledge reports within 72 hours
- Provide a triage decision and next steps within 7 days

These are targets, not guarantees.
